# Michele Brissoni — Builder of nWave.ai | Tech Advisor & CTO

**30+ years from F1 pit lanes to AI-augmented software delivery.**
I build frameworks that turn the way teams write software from chaotic into elite.

My journey started reverse-engineering what made Schumacher-era Ferrari's engineering culture unreplicable and asking: 
> *what if we could engineer that same precision into software teams?*

1️⃣ That question became the [SW Craftsmanship Dojo®](https://swcraftsmanshipdojo.com), which shaped 15,000+ developers across IBM, UniCredit, Coca-Cola, NS Dutch Railways, and KTM. 

2️⃣ It became [BOKaRy](https://bokary.dev), a behavioral OKR governance model linking vision to delivery for boards and investors. 

3️⃣ It became the [Unicorns' Ecosystem™](https://unicorns-ecosystem.com), where purpose, customer centricity, and technical excellence converge.

👉 And now, after seven years of R&D, it's become **nWave**.

## 🌊 nWave — The AI-augmented Framework for Software Crafters

**[nWave](https://nwave.ai)** is an open-source behavioral engineering framework for AI-assisted software delivery. It treats AI agents the way elite teams treat their people: with clear behavioral specs, single responsibilities, adversarial review, and human oversight at every decision point.

The core insight: AI is a mirror. It amplifies whatever patterns already exist — excellent or dysfunctional. Most "AI coding tools" skip this entirely. nWave doesn't.

**What's inside:**
- **6D-WAVE methodology** — ▶️ DISCOVERY 🔄 DISCUSS 🔄 DESIGN 🔄 DISTILL 🔄 DEVELOP 🔄 DEMO ⏮️
- **30+ specialized agents** with behavioral specifications and single responsibility
- **15 agents + 15 counter-agents** — adversarial architecture with mutation testing
- **Double-loop TDD** — modern software engineering quality at every layer
- **EU AI Act compliance** built in, not bolted on.

### Where this has been tested

The principles behind nWave were forged in real, large-scale engagements:

- **IBM**: OKR governance + DORA metrics as PwC-validated indicators; enabled CEO-level orchestration across the enterprise.
- **NS Dutch Railways**: Dojo® rolled to 400+ people; 800% lift in socio-technical maturity; large-scale product modernization.
- **KTM**: 35% reduction in production incidents, 30% infrastructure cost savings through modernization + Dojo culture.
- **ZF Transics**: AWS-based IDP and developer portal; reference case presented at PlatformCon 2025.
- **Venture Studios**: our models power advanced software venture studios. Independent evaluations recognize the Ecosystem as a new category of venture execution model.
- **and many startups**: from pre-seeds to series A+

### The Forge 🔥 of Unicorns

My [podcast](https://go.brix.consulting/Spotify) and [newsletter](https://go.brix.consulting/ForgeOfUnicorns) where 130+ investors and CEOs — backers of companies like Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX — share how they see IT value creation. 80+ episodes and counting.
