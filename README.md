### What I do (for Boards, PE/VC, CEOs & CTOs)
- **BOKaRy (Behavioral-OKR)** — governance that links *vision → behaviors → delivery* for **board-level ROI clarity**.  
  Now evolving into a **productized governance toolkit** for CFOs and boards, reducing advisory dependency and enabling scale.  
- **Unicorns’ Ecosystem™** — the antidote to IT mediocracy; predictable, human-centric org evolution. Where purpose, customer centricity, and technical excellence can **double profit with 20% fewer headcount**.  
- **SW Craftsmanship Dojo®** — behavior-engineered continuous active learning (100k+ devs), turning average teams into elite performers.  
  Forget an army of dev teams: **one team of crafters + the right AI tools will outperform the old army**.
