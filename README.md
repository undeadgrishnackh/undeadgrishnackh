# Michele Brissoni — Builder of nWave.ai | Tech Advisor & CTO

**30+ years from F1 pit lanes to AI-augmented software delivery.**
I build frameworks that turn the way teams write software from chaotic into elite.

My journey started reverse-engineering what made Schumacher-era Ferrari's engineering culture unreplicable and asking: 
> *what if we could engineer that same precision into software teams?*

1️⃣ That question became the [SW Craftsmanship Dojo®](https://swcraftsmanshipdojo.com), which shaped thousands of developers across IBM, UniCredit, Coca-Cola, NS Dutch Railways, and KTM, and many, many more. 

2️⃣ It became [BOKaRy](https://bokary.dev), a behavioral OKR governance model linking vision to delivery for boards and investors. 

3️⃣ It became the [Unicorns' Ecosystem™](https://unicorns-ecosystem.com), where purpose, customer centricity, and technical excellence converge.

👉 And now, after seven years of R&D, it's become **nWave**.

## 🌊 nWave — The AI-augmented Framework for Software Crafters

**[nWave](https://nwave.ai)** is an open-source behavioral engineering framework for AI-assisted software delivery. It treats AI agents the way elite teams treat their people: with clear behavioral specs, single responsibilities, adversarial review, and human oversight at every decision point.

The core insight: AI is a mirror. It amplifies whatever patterns already exist — excellent or dysfunctional. Most "AI coding tools" skip this entirely. nWave doesn't.

**What's inside:**
- **6D-WAVE methodology** — ▶️ DISCOVERY 🔄 DISCUSS 🔄 DESIGN 🔄 DISTILL 🔄 DEVELOP 🔄 DEMO ⏮️
- **30+ specialized agents** with behavioral specifications and single responsibility
- **15 agents + 15 counter-agents** — adversarial architecture with mutation testing
- **Double-loop TDD** — modern software engineering quality at every layer
- **EU AI Act compliance** built in, not bolted on

## 🎯 AI Readiness Assessment — Find your gap before it finds you

Not sure if your team is ready for AI-assisted development? The **[AI Readiness Assessment](https://ai-readiness.dev)** is a free, open-source diagnostic grounded in our model and backed with Stanford SWEPR, DORA 2024-2025, and METR's first randomized controlled trial of AI coding tools.

ONLY four questions. Five minutes. **One score** that reveals the distance between how fast you're adopting AI and how prepared your organization is to absorb it. Since February 2025, the EU AI Act requires organizations to demonstrate developer competence when using AI tools. This assessment shows where you stand and the legal, financial, and brand image risks associated with it.

👉 **[ai-readiness.dev](https://ai-readiness.dev)** — take the assessment

👉 **[source on GitHub](https://github.com/sw-craftsmanship-dojo/sw-ai-readiness-assessment)** — read the research, fork it, contribute

### Where this has been tested

The principles behind these frameworks were forged in real, large-scale engagements:

- **IBM**: OKR governance + DORA metrics as PwC-validated indicators; enabled CEO-level orchestration across the enterprise
- **NS Dutch Railways**: Dojo® rolled to 400+ people; 800% lift in socio-technical maturity; large-scale product modernization
- **KTM**: 35% reduction in production incidents, 30% infrastructure cost savings through modernization + Dojo culture
- **ZF Transics**: AWS-based IDP and developer portal; reference case presented at PlatformCon 2025
- **Venture Studios**: our models power advanced software venture studios. Independent evaluations recognize the Ecosystem as a new category of venture execution model
- **and many startups**: from pre-seeds to series A+

### The Forge 🔥 of Unicorns

My [podcast](https://go.brix.consulting/Spotify) and [newsletter](https://go.brix.consulting/ForgeOfUnicorns) where 130+ investors and CEOs — backers of companies like Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX — share how they see IT value creation. 80+ episodes and counting.
